\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
\shape default
 is a crucial and high-interest area of research in the field of Computer
 Science, which has gained increased traction in recent decades due largely
 to the requirements for increasingly sophisticated AI in games, and the
 implications that development of 
\shape italic
algorithms
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
heuristics
\shape default
 in this area can have on other fields of study such as 
\shape italic
Automated Planning and Scheduling
\shape default
.
 Poker games provide a challenge to 
\shape italic
Intelligent Agents
\shape default
 because of many factors including 
\shape italic
combinatorial explosions
\shape default
 of 
\shape italic
game trees
\shape default
, elements of 
\shape italic
hidden information
\shape default
 such as the cards other players hold, as well as stochastic elements due
 to not knowing which cards are yet to be dealt.
 This differentiates Poker games from more traditional games such as Checkers,
 which is a deterministic 
\shape italic
perfect information
\shape default
 game meaning that each player has the same complete knowledge of the game
 state at any stage and that there is a finite set of moves for each player.
 Therefore at each stage there is an 
\shape italic
optimal move
\shape default
 leading to a winning strategy, and in this manner these games can effectively
 be 
\shape italic
solved
\shape default
, and so when playing against a competent Agent for such a game it is impossible
 to win, only to draw.
 Poker games are different because of the aforementioned stochastic elements,
 imperfect information and complex search trees, necessitating the use of
 more sophisticated algorithms in order for an Agent to perform competently
 versus intelligent opponents.
 While there has been lots of research into Intelligent Agents for traditional
 board games and variants of Poker such as 
\shape italic
Texas Hold'Em
\shape default
, lesser known variants such as the relatively new 
\shape italic
Open Face Chinese Poker
\shape default
 have not been explored to the same degree.
 Agents for Open Face Chinese Poker often suffer from poor performance due
 to reliance on simple algorithms and methods such as 
\shape italic
Rule-Based Systems
\shape default
, which can lead to predictable or sub-optimal play that is additionally
 largely domain specific.
 This dissertation considers the merits and limitations of various AI techniques
, and implements an Intelligent Agent for a bespoke Open Face Chinese Poker
 Web-Application, with discussions of the range of technologies used and
 methodologies employed in creating a functional final product.
 It is advisable for readers unfamiliar with Poker, Computer Science or
 any of the italicised terms found throughout to familiarise themselves
 with the definitions found in the glossary section.

Introduction to Open Face Chinese Poker
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open Face Chinese Poker (commonly abbreviated to 
\shape italic
OFCP
\shape default
) is a perfect or imperfect information (depending on variant)
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Standard OFC is a perfect information game, but other variants such as 
\shape italic

\shape default

\end_inset

 card game, and is a variant of 
\shape italic
Chinese Poker.
 
\shape default
In OFCP, players take turns placing cards face-up into three distinct 
\shape italic
rows
\shape default
 (
\shape italic
bottom
\shape default
, 
\shape italic
middle
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
top
\shape default
), creating the best possible 
\shape italic
poker hands
\shape default
 they can in order to score points from each other.
 Stronger hands score bonus points called 
\shape italic
royalties
\shape default
 and royalty-scoring hands in higher rows score more points than equivalent
 hands in lower rows.
 For example, a 
\shape italic
Royal House
\shape default
 gives +25 bonus points in bottom row, or +50 in the middle row.
 Players score +1 point for each row they win in addition to any royalties.
 In the case that a player wins all 3 rows they score a 
\shape italic
scoop
\shape default
 bonus which grants an additional point for each row, for a total of +6
 base points before royalties are calculated.
 OFCP is a zero-sum game, meaning any gains by one player are balanced with
 losses by another player; players win points directly from their opponents,
 so if a player's score is +16 points then in a 1v1 game it is therefore
 implied that their opponent's score would be -16.

Figure 1.2.1 shows the results and layout of the board after a game of OFCP.
 Player 1 wins bottom with a 
\shape italic
Two Pair
\shape default
 8s and 4s versus a 
\shape italic
Pair
\shape default
 of Qs for +1 point.
 Player 1 also wins middle row with Two Pair 7s and 2s versus Pair of 6s
 for +1 point.
 In top row Player 1 and the computer opponent both have a Pair of 3s, and
 so the third card is taken into account as the 
\shape italic
kicker
\shape default
, with Player 1 clinching the win for +1 point with a King kicker versus
 a 7.
 Further to the individual row scores, because Player 1 won every row they
 score an additional scoop bonus of +3.
\begin_inset Newline newline

One important caveat of the game is that hands in lower rows must be stronger
 than those on the rows above; if a player creates a top-heavy board then
 that player’s hand is invalid, which is known as 
\shape italic
fouling
\shape default
.
 When a player fouls their opponents automatically scoop them for +6 each
 (+1 for each row and +3 scoop bonus) in addition to any royalties, and
 any of the fouled player's royalties are disqualified.
 In the case that all players foul, no points are awarded.

Fig 1.2.2 – Player 1 fouls and so their opponent wins an automatic scoop bonus
 plus royalties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace smallskip
\end_inset

In the game shown in Fig 1.2.2 Player 1 has Pair of 10s in bottom, Pair of
 3s in middle and Pair of 6s in top.
 Because the top row contains a stronger poker hand than the row below it,
 the hand is invalid and the player fouls.
 On top of the +3 scoop bonus and points for individual row wins, the computer
 opponent wins further points for royalties because of its 
\shape italic
Flush
\shape default
 in bottom and 
\shape italic
Three of A Kind
\shape default
 in middle.

 hands 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace smallskip
\end_inset

Fig 1.2.3 indicates how many points can be won from strong hands.
 Player 1 wins bottom row with 
\shape italic
Four of a Kind
\shape default
 8s versus the computer opponent’s Pair of Jacks.
 Player 1 receives +1 point for winning the row, with an additional +10
 points royalty for Four of a Kind on bottom.
 Player 1 also wins middle row with a 
\shape italic
Full House
\shape default
, Aces full of Deuces versus the computer opponent’s Pair of 9s, scoring
 +1 point for winning the row and an additional +12 royalty.
 Player 1 and the computer opponent both have 
\shape italic
High Card
\shape default
 King in the top row, but the computer opponent wins the row because their
 kicker of 10 beats Player 1's 6 kicker.
 The computer opponent wins +1 point for winning this row but the hand is
 not strong enough to score any additional royalties.
 The points each player wins are taken from their opponent, so the final
 score for Player 1 is 
\begin_inset Formula $-1+13+11=23$
\end_inset

, and the computer opponent’s score is the inverse of this, -23.

Problem Description 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Creating sophisticated Intelligent Agents for games with large branching
 factors poses a significant issue, as for the Agent to perform well it
 must be able to search many moves ahead of the current state in order to
 find the optimal move.
 With every additional level of depth searched in a game tree the complexity
 of the search increases exponentially due to combinatorial explosion; at
 a depth of 
\shape italic

\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 
\shape default
with a branching factor 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 there would be approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{d}$
\end_inset

 potential nodes to explore.
 A brute-force Depth First Search would therefore have a time complexity
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $O(B^{d})$
\end_inset

 which is prohibitively complex for any reasonably exhaustive search of
 a game with a high branching factor.
 Consider for example Chess, which has an estimated branching factor of
 35 (Mandziuk, 2010, p4).
 In his influential paper 
\shape italic
Programming a Computer for Playing Chess
\shape default
, Claude Shannon estimated a lower-bound for the game-tree complexity of
 Chess of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{120}$
\end_inset

, asserting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A machine operating at the rate of one variation per second would require
 over 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{90}$
\end_inset

 years to calculate the first move
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Shannon, 1950, p4).
 While in theory exhaustively analysing a game of chess from start to finish
 is possible, it remains implausible with any conceivable modern computer
 despite huge advances in processing speed and power since 1950.

Open Face Chinese Poker does not have such an astronomical space state or
 game-tree complexity as Chess, although unlike Chess it incorporates stochastic
 elements because of its nature as a card game, and the subsequent challenge
 this poses for an Intelligent Agent makes it an interesting area of research.
 Considering there are 
\begin_inset Formula $52!\approx8\times10^{67}$
\end_inset

permutations of a standard deck of cards, representation of each possible
 state in a game tree invokes a combinatorial explosion of branching factor.
 An upper-bound

\end_inset

 with an upper-bound estimate for the game tree size of 
\begin_inset Formula $5.77\times10^{32}$

 which poses a similarly daunting complexity.
 The game tree size was calculated by assuming that both player's first
 5 cards are known and then taking into account from there each player's
 sequential turns for the duration of the game, using the following formula:

The rapid expansion of the search space makes it clear that more processing
 power is not in itself a solution to the problem, as combinatorial explosion
 quickly makes deep searches of these games impractical for any realistic
 purposes; even a machine that could search 1 Trillion (
\begin_inset Formula $10{}^{12}$
\end_inset

) nodes per second would take 
\begin_inset Formula $7\times10^{11}$
\end_inset

 years to perform such an exhaustive search of an entire OFCP game tree.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

However, despite the fact that modern computers are still not powerful enough
 to perform such complex and exhaustive searches, competent Intelligent
 Agents for games such as Chess have emerged regardless.
 The reason this is possible is because of different approaches to the problem,
 or through pruning algorithms which reduce the complexity of the search
 by removing branches of the tree that do not provide beneficial information.
 A variety of algorithms and heuristics have been formalised over the decades,
 with the creation of a multitude of Intelligent Agents of varying competence,
 with wide coverage of more traditional games such as Chess and Checkers,
 and even for more complex games such as Go.
 In terms of artificial intelligence applications for Poker, more well-known
 variants such as Texas Hold'Em have seen lots of interest while more obscure
 variants such as OFCP have remained somewhat untouched.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Intelligent Agents do exist for OFCP, but publicly available implementations
 largely play predictably or sub-optimally, often favouring conservative
 play over taking risks, even in situations where fouling would not be heavily
 penalised (such as when the human opponent is in a fouling position themselves).
 There has been little formal research into Intelligent Agents for OFCP,
 and as such limited source material is available.
 Most existing bots for the game are designed for Poker sites which do not
 have any source code made available, or made by development teams which
 license the software out to Poker players for money such as in the case
 of Warren
\begin_inset Foot

.
 Even with such advanced techniques the game has not been solved, as evidenced
 with the modest claim 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

(Warren) plays almost perfect Open Face Chinese Poker after the 6th card
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Other implementations by hobbyist programmers for personal projects often
 make use of simple algorithms which leads to sub-optimal, exploitable play
 because of predictable or naïve behaviour.
 This project aims to create an Intelligent Agent that performs well versus
 competent human players, and to do so will need to be able to do everything
 a human can in terms of making judgement calls, exploiting the player's
 game position in order to inform its decision as to whether it should take
 a risk or play conservatively to avoid fouling itself.

\begin_layout Subsection
Aims and Objectives 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project aim is to create a functional, competent Intelligent Agent for
 a bespoke Open Face Chinese Poker Web-Application, which can be broken
 down simply into two main objectives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create a game environment for Open Face Chinese Poker (Web-Application)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create an Intelligent Agent which interfaces with the Application and plays
 the game
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beyond these simple functional requirements the Intelligent Agent must meet
 expectations for competent performance, making strong plays and avoiding
 the pitfalls of more simplistic Agents.
 To create a credible degree of perceived intelligence, the Agent must play
 tactically, avoiding fouling on one hand but not playing in such a risk
 averse and conservative manner as to limit potential for scoring and exploitati
on of a weak player position.
 In addition to this, the Agent must be able to make its decisions quickly
 in order to minimise delay in line with user demands for responsiveness.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

With regards to the Web-Application itself there are multiple demands to
 be met in terms of reliability, usability and functionality.
 The interface must be intuitive and aesthetically appealing, and must feel
 responsive and efficient.
 As it will be a Web-Application accessible via the internet efforts must
 be made to optimise performance and decrease loads times through means
 such as compression of assets and redirection minimisation, also enabling
 larger support for multiple concurrent users and increasing scalability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Ethics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethical issues can be a concern in Poker games when playing for money; consider
 for example the implications of a human player unknowingly playing versus
 a Poker Bot.
 This is certainly a major concern for variants of Poker such as Texas Hold'Em
 which has a large online following with numerous websites and applications
 where virtual Poker games are played for real money.
 Open Face Chinese Poker on the other hand is generally only played for
 money in home games, with friends or at casinos as a side-game during or
 after a Texas Hold'Em tournament.
 While some websites do exist for playing OFCP for money, these do not have
 the same level of following as more popular variants of Poker, and the
 Intelligent Agent produced in this project will not provide any kind of
 support for integration with these websites.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In the context of the proposed application, no money will be involved and
 participants will be playing purely for entertainment value and research
 interest in Artificial Intelligence.
 This mitigates potential ethical issues as the project focuses not on aspects
 of gambling but rather on the technologies and methodologies used in creating
 the Web-Application and system architecture, as well as the pros and cons
 of various algorithms for producing a sophisticated Intelligent Agent.

Game Theory 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Game theory – John von Neumann.
 Traditional Game Search: e.g.
 1928 neumann proposes minimax tree search.
 Minimax decision rules dictate that in a 2-player zero-sum perfect information
 game there exists strategies for each player that minimise his maximum
 losses (hence minimax) which must be based on considerations of all the
 adversary’s possible responses.
 The strategy which minimises a player’s maximum losses is called the optimal
 strategy.
 
\begin_inset VSpace smallskip

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Naïve minimax vs alpha-beta pruning: AB pruning eliminates branches of the
 search tree where a possibility has been found which is worse than a previously
 examined move, meaning this branch cannot possibly influence the final
 decision.
 These traditional methods work well for e.g.
 chess, checkers, but are generally insufficient for more complex games
 that cannot be ‘solved’ e.g.
 imperfect information games such as poker.

\begin_layout Standard
MCTS has quickly gained traction as a strong general purpose algorithm for
 AI in games due to its effective results with (if properly implemented)
 low space and time complexity.
 MCTS concentrates on analysing the most promising moves, basing the expansion
 of the search tree on random sampling of the search space.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The game tree in MCTS grows asymmetrically, concentrating on searching more
 promising branches.
 Because of this it achieves better results than classical algorithms in
 games with a high branching factor.
 One of the most enticing benefits of MCTS is that it requires no strategic
 or tactical knowledge about a problem domain other than end conditions
 and legal moves, making MCTS implementations flexible and applicable to
 a variety of problem domains with little modification.

“where vi is the estimated value of the node, ni is the number of the times
 the node has been visited and N is the total number of times that its parent

 C is a tunable bias parameter.
 Exploitation vs Exploration The UCB formula provides a good balance between
 the exploitation of known rewards and the exploration of relatively unvisited
 nodes to encourage their exercise.
 Reward estimates are based on random simulations, so nodes must be visited
 a number of times before these estimates become reliable; MCTS estimates
 will typically be unreliable at the start of a search but converge to reliable
 estimates given sufficient time and perfect estimates given infinite time.”

Improvements to MCTS? Light playouts – random moves.
 Heavy playouts utilise heuristics to influence choice of moves.

 Trees (UCT) method.
 This is the algorithm used in the vast majority of current MCTS implementations.
 UCT may be described as a special case of MCTS, that is: UCT = MCTS + UCB”

“Previous work has adapted MCTS to games which, like Spades, involve hidden
 information.
 This has led to the development of the Information Set Monte Carlo Tree
 Search (ISMCTS) family of algorithms (Cowling, Powley, and Whitehouse 2012).
 ISMCTS achieves a higher win rate than a knowledge-based AI developed by
 AI Factory for the Chinese card game Dou Di Zhu, and also performs well
 in other domains.
 ISMCTS uses determinizations, randomisations of the current game state
 which correspond to guessing hidden information.
 Each determinization is a game state that could conceivably be the actual
 current state, given the AI player’s observations so far.”

ISMTCS useful for games like traditional Texas Hold’Em poker where each
 player is privy to information that others are not – i.e.
 their own cards.
 ISMTCS can model various possible game states/ permutations of what other
 players could have – guessing other players cards based on previous information.
 Not needed for OFCP because all players have the same information – cards
 are placed face up.
 However, could come into play for custom variants of OFC, such as pineapple
 – e.g.
 to model which cards are unlikely to have appeared based on how they play;
 if a player has a king on bottom row but does not pair it in the next hand
 then it is almost certain that the discarded card is not a King.
 Information can be built in this way to influence determined probabilities
 of certain cards appearing and AI can act appropriately.

Naïve – non-optimal and non-trivial to implement.
 Simple histogram algorithm can be used to rank high card, pair, two pair,

 kickers etc.
 -> use this approach for bespoke 3 card evaluator for top row in OFC.
 Very low complexity, efficiency not as much a concern as with 5 card hands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A faster, more efficient algorithm means more hands can be evaluated more
 quickly leading to higher responsiveness and more optimal play – e.g.
 able to evaluate more hands in deeper, broader searches.
 Using “kmanley”’s 5 card poker hand evaluator (handles all hands properly

html css and javascript for website/ app.
 Javascript handles front end, sends POST ‘reqwest’s with game state to
 cherrypy server – backend – which validates the sent game state and then
 calls helper functions (python scripts) for hand evaluation, handling AI
 simulations etc.
 , updates the game state in the database, and returns appropriate response
 e.g.
 cards to be placed, scores at end of game

\begin_layout Subsection
Design Principles 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The design principle adhered to throughout the process of creating the applicati
on was Rapid Application Development using Evolutionary Prototyping, creating
 a functional prototype which was refined and updated to meet changing requireme
nts and to implement new features.
 This approach was perfect for the needs of the project as it allowed for
 lots of flexibility and meant that emphasis could be put on development,
 creating a functional or semi-functional application at each stage which
 implemented some of the planned features, meeting some of the requirements
 and being ready to build upon and develop further into a new version which
 improves upon itself.
 This flexible style is naturally advantageous over a more traditional approach
 such as the Waterfall model which involves rigorously defining specifications
 from the start, which means making changes down the line becomes increasingly
 difficult and costly; such a style of development was appropriated from
 other industries before more suitable methodologies of software development
 were formalised.

 This allowed for a more robust system architecture with reduced stress

\begin_layout Standard
Game states stored in database using mongodb (which is a document-oriented
 database as opposed to a traditional relational database which decreases
 development time and reduces complexity as there is no need to constantly
 transform the data when reading from the database into the python backend.
 Mongodb is scalable and high performance, and allows for flexible data
 structures for example with optional values being handled trivially, with
 the databases getting type information from the data itself meaning they
 can map easily into program objects, which is specifically advantageous
 in this application because of the use of dictionaries to store the game
 state.
 The flexibility and ease of deployment of such a style of database makes
 their use well suited for web-applications such as this one) run in docker
 virtual environment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Version control with github: OFCP-AI private repository.
 Use of version control is paramount as it allows for undesirable changes
 to be rolled back easily, and if something goes wrong there is always working
 versions available to roll back to.
 Using multiple branches (master and experimental) meant that a stable version
 could be maintained while new features were implemented safely on the experimen
tal branch without affecting or potentially breaking the master version.
 Also allows for 'releases' for different versions of the software e.g.
 legacy client-side only, current with feature-full self-contained application

Intelligent Agent- algorithms, heuristics etc
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
write it all here - monte carlo, descision rules for placements/ pruning,

 Everything.

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

First 5 placements approach - find all permutations of possible placements
 (13 choose 5 = ~1.2k) then remove duplicates (e.g.
 ADAHAKASKD and KDASAHASAC - different order but effectively same state)
 -> reduces max states to consider to ~240.
 Next even more pruning/ optimisation by implementing heuristics to evaluate
 hand and remove some obviously bad placements e.g.
 if AI is dealt two cards of same rank, will always place these together
 (removes states with these cards in separate rows).
 Also applies to trips, four of a kind etc.
 -> better the hand the less states considered.
 Worst case scenario with 5 unique ranked cards no straight/ flush potential
 = over 200 states, potentially suboptimal placements due to need to return
 move decision in <= 5 seconds (very little time for each simulation - 5
 seconds to simulate 200 states will not produce best results except with
 exceptional hardware).
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Subsequent card placements a lot easier - carry out simulations for as many
 seconds as possible (hardcoded limits can be tweaked in response to user
 feedback [sweet spot 2-4s, 5s meets requirements but makes game feel somewhat
 slow]).
 Aggregates EV for placements in each row and choose highest result, update
 state return placement info to frontend along with player's next card.
 With only 3 choices to make (place card in top, middle or bottom) can potential
ly get thousands of simulations for each placement which should give close
 to optimal results - see limitations in reflection e.g.
 potential for overvaluing moves.
 Simulated random population of rest of board for scoring EV is naive but
 works well most of the time.

Design - frontend is functional but could have been designed better from

 e.g.
 originally hard-coding player's card image objects rather than dynamically
 creating them with javascript
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Backend works well but if different technologies and languages were used
 could be more efficient - e.g.
 hand evaluators written in C using bitwise operators could evaluate millions
 of hands per second rather than hundreds of thousands - could shave off
 seconds of processing time which could either lead to increased responsiveness
 or allow for more games to be simulated by the AI making it more likely
 to find optimal solutions for hand placements.
 
\begin_inset VSpace smallskip

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The choice of a flexible software methodology worked well overall because
 of the evolving requirements and design choices, as well as the individual
 nature of the project.
 In comparison, in a large team of developers issues with this approach
 could arise from lacking a clear design focus and having limited control
 - a necessary trade-off that is an inevitable consequence of the increased
 flexibility this methodology enables.
 One important pitfall to avoid with Rapid Application Development is focusing
 too much on individual components without getting a clear view of the system's
 design, making minor changes without considering possibilities for an improved
 design structure.
 While there is generally a clear design phase before entering the initial
 implementation stage, there can be a tendency to omit a renewed design
 phase in subsequent implementation cycles leading to a lack of documentation
 which can have large consequences down the line; as Gerber et al.
 (2007) state in the analysis of one case study 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

...
 due to the fact that the design was not formally documented and reviewed,
 the discrepancy was only discovered after the implementation phase.
 This situation caused conflict between developers and analysts and in the
 end necessitated a redesign effort which put unnecessary pressure due to
 time constraints and limited resources on the whole development team
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Design choices in early prototypes had a carry-on effect which meant that
 later down the line code refactoring was necessary in order to create a
 more coherent system structure, which potentially could have been avoided
 or reduced with a stricter design philosophy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An apt example of this is seen in legacy prototypes of the application,
 which were client-side only.
 This was a choice that was made in order to quickly create a functional
 prototype, using JavaScript to simulate processes that would be handled
 elsewhere in the final application's architecture (such as dealing cards).
 This was useful because it resulted in a functional application which implement
ed some of the planned features, leading to a clearer understanding of the
 needs of the project, but had to be adapted later in order to create a
 more logical system structure which could meet the requirements, such as
 backend processing to handle the game states and calculate the Intelligent
 Agent's moves.

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the need for a compromise between finding the optimal solution and
 finishing the request in a reasonable amount of time the number of simulated
 games is limited and therefore it is possible that sub-optimal plays will
 be over-valued due to the element of randomness.

\begin_layout Standard
Add support for other variants of OFC such as pineapple - includes elements
 of hidden information as players choose to discard one card, the identity
 of which is known only to them.
 Will increase complexity of game requiring further modifications/ improvements
 to Agent, and would make any performance issues even more of an obstacle.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace smallskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Intelligent Agent generally favours optimal card placements, but because
 of the element of randomness in evaluating moves there is the potential
 for the AI to mistakenly over-value a sub-optimal move.
 As Whitehouse et al.
 (2013, p5) state 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

With any method based on random simulation, it is inevitable that poor quality
 moves will be chosen with nonzero probability, due to a particularly lucky
 run of simulations making the move appear better than it is
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This potential for inaccurate evaluation of a move's strength has an inverse
 relationship with the number of iterations of simulated games - as the
 number of iterations increase the result diverges to the optimal solution,
 meaning that with an infinite amount of simulations the probability of
 finding the best move is 1.
 The performance of the Intelligent Agent therefore could be improved with
 more processing power and/or a longer allocated time to simulate games,
 although it is important to note that there are diminishing returns with
 this strategy; doubling the iterations does not mean that the results will
 be twice as good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This ties in with the choices made for the implementation and configuration
 of the Agent, specifically in regards to compromises between responsiveness
 and finding the best move - in the specified requirements the Agent was
 intended to take no more than 5 seconds to calculate its turn, and the
 application satisfies this requirement.
 However, increasing the iterations would make satisfying this criteria
 infeasible without increased processing power or through further optimisation.
 This could be achieved in various ways, for example by rewriting the applicatio
n in a more efficient language such as C, or by implementing more advanced
 heuristics to reduce the complexity of the calculations, or using a different
 algorithm such as a more advanced implementation of the Monte Carlo method
 like Monte Carlo Tree Search with UCT, as discussed in Section 2 of this
 dissertation.
 Overall the implementation of the Intelligent Agent satisfies the specified
 requirements and works well for its intended purpose in the scope of this
 application, but for larger scale implementations would likely need to
 make use of one or more of these changes in order to achieve increased
 scalability, for example for use in a commercial application with thousands
 of concurrent users.

Poker Variants
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Texas Hold'Em
\series default
 is a popular variant of Poker where each player receives 2 cards for use
 individually in combination with 5 community cards shared between all players,
 with players combining any of their available cards in order to create
 the strongest standard poker hand possible
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Chinese Poker
\series default
 is a variant of poker where players are dealt 13 cards which they must
 arrange into three rows, placed face down.
 Players announce in clockwise order whether or not they wish to play their
 hand, and then all players announce their royalties and show their cards
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Open Face Chinese Poker
\series default
 is a variant of Chinese Poker where players act in clockwise order, receiving
 first 5 cards which are placed face up and then one card at a time until
 all players have placed 13 cards.
 Players must create valid hands consisting of stronger poker hands in lower
 rows, and score points from their opponents for winning corresponding rows.
 Additional points known as royalties can be won for particularly strong
 hands
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Pineapple OFC 
\series default
is a sub-variant of Open Face Chinese Poker, following the same basic rules
 as the standard variant with the distinction that in subsequent rounds
 after the initial 5 card placements, players receive 3 cards and choose
 to place 2 and discard 1.
 This introduces higher action play as well as elements of hidden information
 as other players are unaware of which cards their opponents have discarded,
 although there is potential to infer this information based off of how
 the player acts 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Poker Hands Guide (Weakest to Strongest)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
High Card
\series default
 is the lowest ranking poker hand and is the default when no other hands
 have been made.
 An example High Card is the Jack of Spades, which would beat any hand comprised
 of a High Card ranked 10 or less, but would lose to a High Card Queen,
 King, Ace, or any stronger poker hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Pair
\series default
 is the second weakest poker hand.
 A player has a pair when they have two cards of the same rank, for example
 the 7 of Hearts and 7 and Clubs would form a Pair of 7s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Two Pair
\series default
 is the next strongest hand rank, consisting of two different pairs.
 For example having the 5 of Spades, 5 of Diamonds, 9 of Hearts and 9 of
 Clubs would form Two Pair 9s and 5s.
 When comparing a Two Pair to another Two Pair the highest ranked pair takes
 precedence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Three of a Kind
\series default
 or a 
\series bold
Set
\series default
 beats Two Pairs, Pairs and High Cards and consists of three same-ranked
 cards, such as the Ace of Spades, Ace of Diamonds and Ace of Hearts, which
 would form Three of a Kind Aces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Straight
\series default
 is a hand where a player has 5 sequential cards, such as 4 of Diamonds,
 5 of Hearts, 6 of Hearts, 7 of Clubs, 8 of Spades, which would form a Straight
 8 High.
 The lowest ranked straight spans Ace to 5 and the highest ranked straight
 spans 10 to Ace.
 It is important to note that straights do not wrap around; you cannot form
 a straight such as Queen, King, Ace, Deuce, 3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Flush
\series default
 is one of the stronger poker hands, consisting of cards which are all the
 same suit.
 For example the 6 of Hearts, 9 of Hearts, Jack of Hearts, Queen of Hearts
 and King of Hearts would form a King High Flush.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Full House
\series default
, sometimes known as a 
\series bold
Boat
\series default
, is one of the strongest poker hands available, and comprises both a Three
 of a Kind and an additional Pair.
 For example Three of a Kind Tens with Pair of Jacks would combine to form
 a Full House, Tens full of Jacks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Four of a Kind
\series default
 is a hand obtained when a player has every instance of a particular card
 rank, such as King of Hearts, King of Diamonds, King of Clubs and King
 of Spades which would form Four of a Kind Kings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Straight Flush
\series default
 is effectively the strongest poker hand possible, consisting of 5 sequential
 same suited cards.
 For example the 4 of Spades, 5 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 7 of Spades and
 8 of Spades would form a Straight Flush 8 High.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Royal Flush
\series default
 is a special instance of a Straight Flush where a player has the 10, Jack,

 There are three different rows as described below
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Bottom Row
\series default
 or

 to be valid.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Top Row
\series default
 or 
\series bold
Front Hand
\series default
 consists of 3 cards, meaning the best possible hand here is a Three of

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Scoop
\series default
 is a bonus awarded to a player when they win all 3 rows against an opponent.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Fouling
\series default
 occurs when a player plays an invalid hand, for example by putting a stronger
 hand in their middle row than their bottom row.
 When a player fouls any of their royalties are null, and their opponent
 is automatically awarded a scoop bonus so long as their hand is valid.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Kicker
\series default
 is the term used to describe the next card taken into account when comparing
 two otherwise equal hands.
 For example, if both Player 1 and Player 2 have a Pair of 8s then the rest
 of their cards would be considered, and whichever player has the highest
 rank wins.
 If both players kicker is equivalent then the next highest kicker will
 come into play and so on.

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Royalties
\series default
 are bonus points awarded to player's for particularly strong hands.
 Just like any other points a player wins, they are taken directly from
 opposing players.
 Hands in higher rows score higher royalties than equivalent hands in lower
 rows.
 For example, a Full House in bottom row is worth 6 points in bottom or
 12 points in middle.
 Another example is that a Three of a Kind in bottom row scores no royalty,
 but gets 2 bonus points in middle and between 10 and 22 points in top depending
 on the rank (Three of a Kind Deuces scores 10 points up to Three of a Kind
 Aces with 22 points).

\series bold
Artificial Intelligence 
\series default
is a field of study in Computer Science which focuses on simulating intelligent
 behaviour in computers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Automated Planning and Scheduling 
\series default
is a branch of artificial intelligence which focuses on strategies and actions
 to be performed by Intelligent Agents or autonomous robots.
 Research into optimisations and improved heuristics is a key area of interest
 due to the potentially huge complexity of problems and solutions.

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\series bold
Branching Factor
\series default
 is the average amount of branches from a node in a tree, indicating the
 tree's complexity.
 At a depth of 
\shape italic
d
\shape default
 with a branching factor of 
\shape italic
B
\shape default
 there would be approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{d}$

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Combinatorial Explosion
\series default
 is the phenomenon of exponential growth encountered in search problems.
 Deeper searches become increasingly complex increasing by the branching
 factor at each level
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A 
\series bold
Game Tree
\series default
 represents possible states in a game, with each node representing a possible
 position and each edge representing a possible move
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Game Theory
\series default
 is a branch of mathematics focused on determining optimal strategies and
 decisions in competitive situations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Heuristics
\series default
 are techniques used when classical approaches would fail or be prohibitively
 slow to complete.
 Heuristics use intelligent guesses to reduce the complexity of problems.
 For example in the context of a Chess game rather than trying to explore
 every single possible move and subsequent tree branch, a heuristic based
 approach would ignore branches starting with clearly bad moves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Hidden Information
\series default
 is relevant information available to one or more agents but not others.
 For example in a Poker game, the cards that players individually possess
 or have discarded are known to them but are hidden from other players.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An 
\series bold
Intelligent Agent
\series default
 is an autonomous software entity that perceives and acts upon its environment,
 performing reasoning in order to solve problems and determine actions,
 exhibiting goal-oriented behaviour.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\series bold
Optimal Move
\series default
 or 
\series bold
Optimal Strategy
\series default
 is the move or strategy that will lead to the most favourable outcome for
 an Agent 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Perfect Information Games
\series default
 are games where at any stage all relevant information is available to an
 agent in order to inform its decision.
 In comparison in an 
\series bold
Imperfect Information Game
\series default
 certain information about the game state or prior actions are unknown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Rule Based Systems
\series default
 store expert knowledge for a particular domain as a set of rules which
 can be used in various artificial intelligence applications.
 Rule Based Systems are used extensively for a wide range of purposes such
 as game playing, credit card authorisation and fraud detection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Solved Games
\series default
 are games where the outcome (Win/Loss/Draw) can be predicted at any stage
 assuming optimal play by all players
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A 
\series bold
Zero-Sum Game
\series default
 is a game in which a player's gains are losses are balanced by another
 player's gains or losses.
 Open Face Chinese Poker is an example of a Zero-Sum Game as a player's
 gains are directly taken from their opponent.
