\begin_layout Abstract

\shape italic
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
\shape default
 is a crucial and high-interest area of research in the field of Computer
 Science, which has gained increased traction in recent decades due largely
 to the requirements for increasingly sophisticated AI in games, and the
 implications that development of 
\shape italic
algorithms
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
heuristics
\shape default
 in this area can have beyond the domain of game-playing in other fields
 of study such as 
\shape italic
Automated Planning and Scheduling
\shape default
.
 Poker games provide a challenge to 
\shape italic
Intelligent Agents
\shape default
 because of many factors including 
\shape italic
combinatorial explosions
\shape default
 of 
\shape italic
game trees
\shape default
, elements of 
\shape italic
hidden information
\shape default
 such as the cards other players hold, as well as stochastic elements due
 to not knowing which cards are yet to be dealt.
 This differentiates Poker games from more traditional games such as Checkers,
 which is a deterministic 
\shape italic
perfect information
\shape default
 game meaning that each player has the same complete knowledge of the game
 state at any stage and that there is a finite set of moves for each player.
 Therefore at each stage there is an 
\shape italic
optimal move
\shape default
 leading to a winning strategy, and in this manner these games can effectively
 be 
\shape italic
solved
\shape default
, and so when playing against a competent Agent for such a game it is impossible
 to win, only to draw.
 Poker games are different because of the aforementioned stochastic elements,
 imperfect information and complex search trees, necessitating the use of
 more sophisticated algorithms in order for an Agent to perform competently
 versus intelligent opponents.
 While there has been lots of research into Intelligent Agents for traditional
 board games and variants of Poker such as 
\shape italic
Texas Hold'Em
\shape default
, lesser known variants such as the relatively new 
\shape italic
Open Face Chinese Poker
\shape default
 have not been explored to the same degree.
 Agents for Open Face Chinese Poker often suffer from poor performance due
 to reliance on simple algorithms and methods such as 
\shape italic
Rule-Based Systems
\shape default
, which can lead to predictable or sub-optimal play that is additionally
 largely domain specific.
 This dissertation considers the merits and limitations of various AI techniques
, and implements an Intelligent Agent for a bespoke Open Face Chinese Poker
 Web-Application, with discussions of the range of technologies used and
 methodologies employed in creating a functional final product.
 It is advisable for readers unfamiliar with Poker, Computer Science or
 any of the italicised terms found throughout to familiarise themselves
 with the definitions found in the glossary section.

Introduction to Open Face Chinese Poker
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open Face Chinese Poker (commonly abbreviated to 
\shape italic
OFCP
\shape default
) is a perfect or imperfect information (depending on variant)
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Standard OFCP is a perfect information game, but other variants such as
 
\shape italic
Pineapple OFC
\shape default
 also feature elements of hidden information
\end_layout

\end_inset

 card game, and is a variant of 
\shape italic
Chinese Poker.
 
\shape default
In OFCP, players take turns placing cards face-up into three distinct 
\shape italic
rows
\shape default
 (
\shape italic
bottom
\shape default
, 
\shape italic
middle
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
top
\shape default
), creating the best possible 
\shape italic
poker hands
\shape default
 they can in order to score points from each other.
 Stronger hands score bonus points called 
\shape italic
royalties
\shape default
 and royalty-scoring hands in higher rows score more points than equivalent
 hands in lower rows.
 For example, a 
\shape italic
Royal House
\shape default
 gives +25 bonus points in bottom row, or +50 in the middle row.
 Players score +1 point for each row they win in addition to any royalties.
 In the case that a player wins all 3 rows they score a 
\shape italic
scoop
\shape default
 bonus which grants an additional point for each row, for a total of +6
 base points before royalties are calculated.
 OFCP is a zero-sum game, meaning any gains by one player are balanced with
 losses by another player; players win points directly from their opponents,
 so if a player's score is +16 points then in a 1v1 game it is therefore
 implied that their opponent's score would be -16.

Figure 1.2.1 shows the results and layout of the board after a game of OFCP.
 Player 1 wins bottom with a 
\shape italic
Two Pair
\shape default
 8s and 4s versus a 
\shape italic
Pair
\shape default
 of Qs for +1 point.
 Player 1 also wins middle row with Two Pair 7s and 2s versus Pair of 6s
 for +1 point.
 In top row Player 1 and the computer opponent both have a Pair of 3s, and
 so the third card is taken into account as the 
\shape italic
kicker
\shape default
, with Player 1 clinching the win for +1 point with a King kicker versus
 a 7.
 Further to the individual row scores, because Player 1 won every row they
 score an additional scoop bonus of +3.
\begin_inset Newline newline

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

One important caveat of the game is that hands in lower rows must be stronger
 than those on the rows above; if a player creates a top-heavy board then
 that player’s hand is invalid, which is known as 
\shape italic
fouling
\shape default
.
 When a player fouls their opponents automatically scoop them for +6 each
 (+1 for each row and +3 scoop bonus) in addition to any royalties, and
 any of the fouled player's royalties are disqualified.
 In the case that all players foul, no points are awarded.

Fig 1.2.2 – Player 1 fouls and so their opponent wins an automatic scoop bonus
 plus royalties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace smallskip
\end_inset

In the game shown in Fig 1.2.2 Player 1 has Pair of 10s in bottom, Pair of
 3s in middle and Pair of 6s in top.
 Because the top row contains a stronger poker hand than the row below it,
 the hand is invalid and the player fouls.
 On top of the +3 scoop bonus and points for individual row wins, the computer
 opponent wins further points for royalties because of its 
\shape italic
Flush
\shape default
 in bottom and 
\shape italic
Three of A Kind
\shape default
 in middle.

Fig 1.2.3 – Player 1 wins a lot of bonus points from royalties for strong
 hands 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace smallskip
\end_inset

Fig 1.2.3 indicates how many points can be won from strong hands.
 Player 1 wins bottom row with 
\shape italic
Four of a Kind
\shape default
 8s versus the computer opponent’s Pair of Jacks.
 Player 1 receives +1 point for winning the row, with an additional +10
 points royalty for Four of a Kind on bottom.
 Player 1 also wins middle row with a 
\shape italic
Full House
\shape default
, Aces full of Deuces versus the computer opponent’s Pair of 9s, scoring
 +1 point for winning the row and an additional +12 royalty.
 Player 1 and the computer opponent both have 
\shape italic
High Card
\shape default
 King in the top row, but the computer opponent wins the row because their
 kicker of 10 beats Player 1's 6 kicker.
 The computer opponent wins +1 point for winning this row but the hand is
 not strong enough to score any additional royalties.
 The points each player wins are taken from their opponent, so the final
 score for Player 1 is 
\begin_inset Formula $-1+13+11=23$
\end_inset

, and the computer opponent’s score is the inverse of this, -23.

Problem Description 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Creating sophisticated Intelligent Agents for games with large branching
 factors poses a significant challenge, as for the Agent to perform well
 it must be able to search many moves ahead of the current state in order
 to find the optimal move.
 With every additional level of depth searched in a game tree the complexity
 of the search increases exponentially due to combinatorial explosion; at
 a depth of 
\shape italic

\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 
\shape default
with a branching factor 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 there would be approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{d}$
\end_inset

 potential nodes to explore.
 A brute-force Depth First Search would therefore have a time complexity
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $O(B^{d})$
\end_inset

 which is prohibitively complex for any reasonably exhaustive search of
 a game with a high branching factor.
 Consider for example Chess, which has an estimated branching factor of
 35 (Mandziuk, 2010, p4).
 In his influential paper 
\shape italic
Programming a Computer for Playing Chess
\shape default
, Claude Shannon estimated a lower-bound for the game-tree complexity of
 Chess of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{120}$
\end_inset

, asserting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A machine operating at the rate of one variation per second would require
 over 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{90}$
\end_inset

 years to calculate the first move
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Shannon, 1950, p4).
 While in theory exhaustively analysing a game of chess from start to finish
 is possible, it remains implausible with any conceivable modern computer
 despite huge advances in processing speed and power since 1950.

Open Face Chinese Poker does not have such an astronomical space state or
 game-tree complexity as Chess, although unlike Chess it incorporates stochastic
 elements because of its nature as a card game, and the subsequent challenge
 this poses for an Intelligent Agent makes it an interesting area of research.
 Considering there are 
\begin_inset Formula $52!\approx8\times10^{67}$
\end_inset

 permutations of a standard deck of cards, representation of each possible
 state in a game tree invokes a combinatorial explosion of branching factor.
 An upper-bound
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This estimate is generous as it includes duplicate states e.g.

 for possible final game states is

\end_inset

 with an upper-bound estimate for the game tree size of 
\begin_inset Formula $5.77\times10^{32}$
\end_inset

 which poses a similarly daunting complexity.
 The game tree size was calculated by assuming that both player's first
 5 cards are known and then taking into account from there each player's
 sequential turns for the duration of the game, using the following formula:

The rapid expansion of the search space makes it clear that more processing
 power is not in itself a solution to the problem, as combinatorial explosion
 quickly makes deep searches of these games impractical for any realistic
 purposes; even a machine that could search 1 Trillion (
\begin_inset Formula $10{}^{12}$
\end_inset

) nodes per second would take 
\begin_inset Formula $7\times10^{11}$
\end_inset

 years to perform such an exhaustive search of an entire OFCP game tree.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

However, despite the fact that modern computers are still not powerful enough
 to perform such complex and exhaustive searches, competent Intelligent
 Agents for games such as Chess have emerged regardless.
 The reason this is possible is because of different approaches to the problem,
 or through pruning algorithms which reduce the complexity of the search
 by removing branches of the tree that do not provide beneficial information.
 A variety of algorithms and heuristics have been formalised over the decades,
 with the creation of a multitude of Intelligent Agents of varying competence,
 with wide coverage of more traditional games such as Chess and Checkers,
 and even for more complex games such as Go.
 In terms of artificial intelligence applications for Poker, more well-known
 variants such as Texas Hold'Em have seen lots of interest while more obscure
 variants such as OFCP have remained somewhat untouched.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Intelligent Agents do exist for OFCP, but publicly available implementations
 largely play predictably or sub-optimally, often favouring conservative
 play over taking risks, even in situations where fouling would not be heavily
 penalised (such as when the human opponent is in a fouling position themselves).
 There has been little formal research into Intelligent Agents for OFCP,
 and as such limited source material is available.
 Most existing bots for the game are designed for Poker sites which do not
 have any source code made available, or made by development teams which
 license the software out to Poker players for money such as in the case
 of Warren
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Warren is an OFCP bot which uses neural networks to train and improve, licensed

, which uses neural networks to learn and improve over time as it plays
 against human opponents.
 Even with such advanced techniques the game has not been solved, as evidenced
 by the modest claim that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

(Warren) plays almost perfect Open Face Chinese Poker after the 6th card
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Other implementations of Agents for OFCP by hobbyist programmers for personal
 projects often make use of simple algorithms which leads to sub-optimal,
 exploitable play because of predictable or naïve behaviour.
 This project aims to create an Intelligent Agent that performs well versus
 competent human players, and to do so will need to be able to do everything
 a human can in terms of making judgement calls, exploiting the player's
 game position in order to inform its decision as to whether it should take
 a risk or play conservatively to avoid fouling itself.

\begin_layout Subsection
Aims and Objectives 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project aim is to create a functional, competent Intelligent Agent for
 a bespoke Open Face Chinese Poker Web-Application, which can be broken
 down simply into two main objectives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create a game environment for Open Face Chinese Poker (Web-Application)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create an Intelligent Agent which interfaces with the Application and plays
 the game
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beyond these simple functional requirements the Intelligent Agent must meet
 expectations for competent performance, making strong plays and avoiding
 the pitfalls of more simplistic Agents.
 To create a credible degree of perceived intelligence, the Agent must play
 tactically, avoiding fouling on one hand but not playing in such a risk
 averse and conservative manner as to limit potential for scoring and exploitati
on of a weak player position.
 In addition to this, the Agent must be able to make its decisions quickly
 in order to minimise delay in line with user demands for responsiveness.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

With regards to the Web-Application itself there are multiple demands to
 be met in terms of reliability, usability and functionality.
 The interface must be intuitive and aesthetically appealing, and must feel
 responsive and efficient.
 As it will be a Web-Application accessible via the internet efforts must
 be made to optimise performance and decrease loads times through means
 such as compression of assets and redirection minimisation, also enabling
 larger support for multiple concurrent users and increasing scalability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Ethics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ethical issues can be a concern in Poker games when playing for money; consider
 for example the implications of a human player unknowingly playing versus
 a Poker Bot.
 This is certainly a major concern for variants of Poker such as Texas Hold'Em
 which has a large online following with numerous websites and applications
 where virtual Poker games are played for real money.
 Open Face Chinese Poker on the other hand is generally only played for
 money in home games, with friends or at casinos as a side-game during or
 after a Texas Hold'Em tournament.
 While some websites do exist for playing OFCP for money, these do not have
 the same level of following as more popular variants of Poker, and the
 Intelligent Agent produced in this project will not provide any kind of
 support for integration with these websites.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In the context of the proposed application, no money will be involved and
 participants will be playing purely for entertainment value and research
 interest in Artificial Intelligence.
 This mitigates potential ethical issues as the project focuses not on aspects
 of gambling but rather on the technologies and methodologies used in creating
 the Web-Application and system architecture, as well as the pros and cons
 of various algorithms for producing a sophisticated Intelligent Agent.

Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Game Theory 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In game theory, a zero-sum perfect information game such as Chess or Checkers
 can be formalised as a search problem, representing possible game states
 in a game tree (Özcan, 2004, p282).
 Such a tree can be explored and analysed in order to determine the best
 move from a given position, and to do so it is necessary to implement some
 form of search algorithm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Minimax 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While game theory has been discussed at least as far back as 1713, it wasn't
 until John von Neumman's research into the field that game theory was establish
ed as a mathematical discipline.
 Neumann's early efforts focused on proving the Minimax Theorem, which was
 published in his 1928 paper 
\shape italic
Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele
\shape default
 (The Theory of Board Games).
 Proving the Minimax Theorem was considered by Neumman to be of utmost importanc
e, saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I thought there was nothing worth publishing until the Minimax Theorem was
 proved
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Casti, 1996, p19).
 The Minimax Theorem states that in any finite zero-sum two player game
 there exists strategies for each player that minimise their maximum losses.
 These strategies must consider their adversary's possible responses, and
 the strategy which minimises a player's maximum losses is known as the
 optimal strategy.
 Expanding on his 1928 paper, Neumman co-authored 
\shape italic
Theory of Games and Economic Behavior
\shape default
 in 1944, which presented a different proof of the Minimax Theorem, extending
 the theorem to include imperfect information games and games with more
 than two players.
 This 1944 publication was the first formal, coherent book in the field
 of game theory and is the basis for modern game theory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minimax searches a game tree, looking for moves that maximise a player's
 chance of winning.
 A minimax approach uses an evaluation function to score possible game states,
 choosing the moves that lead to the highest expected value for a given
 Agent.
 Implementation of a minimax search assumes that the opponent will play
 optimally and thus choose the next state with the lowest score from the
 Agent's perspective.
 A naïve minimax approach will produce optimal results assuming a perfect
 evaluation function, but explores nodes unnecessarily and takes a very
 long time because it will exhaustively expand the game tree, and due to
 combinatorial explosion is prohibitively slow for all but the most simple
 of games, or when exploration of the tree is limited to a certain depth.
 Tic-Tac-Toe for example has 
\begin_inset Formula $9!=362,880$
\end_inset

 possible outcomes, which is feasible for a computer to compute, but this
 huge amount of nodes to consider for such a simple game demonstrates the
 impracticality of this naïve approach.
 For these reasons its use is limited in games with high branching factors
 unless optimisations are made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Alpha-Beta Pruning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alpha-Beta Pruning is an optimisation of the minimax algorithm, reducing
 the number of nodes that must be visited in a search.
 It was discovered independently a number of times by various researchers
 throughout the mid 20th century, and Arthur Samuel implemented an early
 version for Checkers in 1959 (Samuel, 1959, p210-229).
 This optimisation of the minimax algorithm is achieved through keeping
 track of and updating two scores; Alpha, which keeps a record of the best
 score possible by any means; and Beta, the worst-case scenario for the
 opponent.
 Any move with a value lower than this Alpha score can safely be pruned
 since a better move has already been found, and with the Beta value it
 can be assumed that any discovered move with a value higher than this will
 not be used by the opponent.
 With Alpha-Beta Pruning, a branch of the game tree is pruned when at least
 one possibility is found that is worse than a previously examined move.
 Pruning away branches in this way does not affect the quality of the result
 as these branches could not possibly influence the final decision, and
 therefore Alpha-Beta Pruning returns the exact same move as a standard
 minimax approach would, but does so faster and more efficiently.
 In the worst case Alpha-Beta Pruning must examine 
\begin_inset Formula $O(b^{d})$
\end_inset

 leaf nodes, although assuming that best moves are always searched first,
 the number of leaf nodes evaluated will be as low as 
\begin_inset Formula $O(\sqrt{b^{d}})$
\end_inset

, reducing the branching factor to its square root, effectively meaning
 a search can be made to twice the depth with the same amount of computation
 (Russell, 2003).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Solving Games
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even with optimised approaches to game tree searches, managing and mitigating
 the complexity of game trees remains difficult due to high average branching
 factors.
 Simple games such as Tic-Tac-Toe can be trivially solved, and even more
 complex games like Checkers can be weakly solved with traditional algorithms.
 However, solving more complex games such as Chess and Go still remains
 a challenge.
 Chess can be partially solved with retrograde algorithms, solved for only
 some positions or when using smaller non-standard boards.
 Solving Chess is generally considered impossible with modern technology,
 and it is debatable as to whether future improvements in computer processing
 speeds will one day allow for brute-force solving of the game.
 Intelligent Agents for Go using traditional approaches generally can only
 perform well in a limited capacity, such as when playing on a much smaller
 than usual board.
 It is not expected for full-size 19x19 board Go to be solved anywhere in
 the near future, although modern approaches to creating Intelligent Agents
 for Go produce Agents that can play to a good standard.

Games of Chance and Imperfect Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aforementioned board games have all been zero-sum perfect information
 deterministic games, which makes them well suited for the application of
 traditional search methods such as minimax and its derivatives.
 However, games such as Poker are stochastic in nature because of random
 cards, and in addition to any elements of imperfect information, this presents
 a challenge for implementation of an Intelligent Agent.
 Imperfect Information game trees can be made, using chance and decision
 nodes that are grouped into information sets, however since these nodes
 are not independent it means that algorithms such as Alpha-Beta Pruning
 cannot be used (Dizman, n.d, p3).

\begin_layout Subsection
Monte Carlo Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Monte Carlo methods are computational algorithms which use random sampling
 over multiple trial runs in order to obtain usable, numerical results.
 Modern Monte Carlo methods have origins in the 1940s during work on nuclear
 weapons projects, and were used in the simulations required for the Manhattan
 Project, although were limited by the lack of technology at the time (Eckhardt,
 1987, p131).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implementation of Monte Carlo methods generally involves defining possible
 inputs and then randomly generating inputs within this range, computing
 the value or result for each simulation and finally aggregating results.
 An example of this process is illustrated below in the context of calculating
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 by random distribution of points within a given area.
 As the number of trials increases the fraction of points distributed within
 the circle's area diverges on 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi}{4}$
\end_inset

, which can then be multiplied by 4 to give a reasonably accurate estimation
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Subsection
Monte Carlo Tree Search
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Monte Carlo methods can be used with good results for applications in games,
 and since 2006 have been developed into a technique called 
\shape italic
Monte Carlo Tree Search
\shape default
 
\shape italic
(MCTS)
\shape default
, a term coined by Rémi Coulom during his application of the method to play
 Go through expansion of the search tree based on random sampling (Coulom,
 2007, p72-83).
 In MCTS, simulated games or 
\shape italic
playouts
\shape default
 are played out to the end through random move selection, and the final
 result of each simulation is used to weight the nodes used, meaning that
 better nodes are more likely to be chosen in future playouts.
 MCTS in its most basic form follows a fairly simply process, generating
 and scoring a search tree node by node according to the results of the
 simulated playouts.
 The diagram below illustrates this.

\begin_layout Standard
MCTS has quickly gained traction as a strong general purpose algorithm for
 AI in games due to its effective results with potentially low space and
 time complexity.
 The game tree in MCTS grows asymmetrically, with more promising branches
 being favoured for exploration.
 Because of this MCTS can be more efficient than traditional algorithms
 and produce better results as it is better suited to dealing with the problems
 posed by high branching factors.
 One of the most enticing benefits of MCTS is that it requires no strategic
 or tactical knowledge about a problem domain other than end conditions
 and legal moves, making MCTS implementations flexible and applicable to
 a variety of problem domains with little modification (Browne et al., 2012,
 p9).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Upper Confidence Bounds Enhancement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the basic MCTS algorithm is not perfect, there have been many proposed
 enhancements.
 Perhaps the most well known of these uses an 
\shape italic

\shape default
formula formalised by Kocsis and Szepesvári (2006, p1-12), as shown below.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the estimated value of a node, 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is a tunable exploration parameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the number of times the nodes has been visited and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the total number of times the node's parent has been visited.
 This enhancement provides a strong balance between exploitation of high
 scoring nodes and exploration of nodes that have not been explored thoroughly.
 As with any method based on random sampling, initial estimates will not
 be reliable but over time and with more iterations the results will diverge
 on finding the optimal move.
 Use of UCB with MCTS is known as the 
\shape italic
Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees
\shape default
 (UCT) method.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the asymmetric tree growth MCTS is suitable for deep and broad
 explorations of larger search spaces that would be infeasible for a typical
 search algorithm, and because of the adaptability in regards to exploitation
 and exploration, optimal moves will be found and focused on.
 MCTS therefore has revolutionised Artificial Intelligence approaches, most
 notably in Go which has seen various successful applications of MCTS and
 MCTS with UCT to create sophisticated Intelligent Agents which present
 a credible challenge to even skilled human opponents

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS) follows on from application
 of MCTS to games involving hidden information, aiming to overcome the shortcomi
ng of previous approaches to dealing with hidden information such as determinisa
tion techniques.
 ISMCTS uses randomisations of the current game state to make guesses of
 hidden information, with each determinisation conceivably representing
 what could actually be the current game state based on the Agent's observations
 so far (Whitehouse et al, 2013, p101).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ISMCTS is useful for games like traditional Texas Hold’Em poker where elements
 of hidden information mean an Agent lacks all necessary information to
 make a well-informed decision.
 ISMCTS models various possible game state variations of what other players
 could have, attempting to guess other players cards based on previous informati
on.
 An advantage of ISMCTS over approaches such as determinised UCT is the
 use of better strategies which more closely resemble the decision making
 processes that a human player would make (Cowling et al, 2012, p121).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This approach is not needed for standard OFCP because it is a perfect informatio
n game.
 However, ISMCTS could come into play in an implementation of a custom variant
 of OFCP such as Pineapple OFC, which does have elements of hidden information
 due to players secretly discarding one of their dealt cards each hand.
 ISMCTS could be used to model which cards are unlikely to have appeared
 based on how the opponent plays; for example, if a player has a King on
 bottom row but does not pair it in the next hand then it is almost certain
 that the discarded card is not a King.
 Information can be built in this way to influence determined probabilities
 of certain cards appearing and the Intelligent Agent can act appropriately,
 tweaking expected probabilities for outs and changing strategy to match
 this information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Hand Evaluation Algorithms 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For any Poker game - and indeed for any Poker AI - hand evaluator functions
 are necessary to rank, score and compare hands.
 A naïve approach to the problem could involve step-by-step comparison of
 a given hand against each entry in a comprehensive list of hands and matching
 ranks.
 Such a technique would generally prove efficient in terms of time-complexity
 and could prove to be significantly faster than performing scoring calculations
 on demand.
 One problem with this approach however is that it would necessarily involve
 pre-computation and scoring of every single possible hand combination,
 which would undoubtedly be a lengthy process.
 Another issue is potential memory and space constraints, dependent on the
 system and application in question.
 There are 
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{52}{5}=2,598,960$
\end_inset

 possible Poker Hands, and representation of each would amount to a sizeable
 lookup table

.
 This could prove problematic for example in the case of a pre-packaged
 application; it would be incredibly undesirable to include such a large
 file.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In situations where such a technique is infeasible or undesirable, for example
 due to memory constraints, other approaches are possible.
 On-demand hand evaluation can be achieved in a variety of ways, for example
 through a simple histogram approach which reads in a hand and records the
 frequency of each card rank.
 Using this information the evaluator would be able to work out the hands
 rank based on highest rank frequencies.
 For example, a hand consisting of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

2 of diamonds, 2 of hearts, 5 of clubs, 7 of spades, King of diamonds
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would be represented in a histogram as seen below.

Table 2.6.1 - Demonstrating how a histogram approach would store information
 about a hand
\begin_inset VSpace smallskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this example the evaluator would then analyse the histogram, recognising
 that the highest frequency rank was 2 (indicating a pair), and that no
 other frequency was higher than 1 (indicating there is no second pair),
 and that the highest ranked card with a frequency above 0 was a King.
 A potential format of this information could be along the lines of 
\begin_inset Formula $[1,2,13]$
\end_inset

, where the first number indicates the overall hand rank (1 signifying a
 Pair), the second number indicating the rank of the card with this frequency
 (2), and the third number indicating the kicker (13 signifying a King).
 This could then be used directly elsewhere for comparison, or interpreted
 into a more readable format such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Pair of 2s, King kicker
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advantage of this approach comes in its simplicity as it is trivial
 to implement and easy to understand, and provides a strong compromise between
 space and time complexity.
 One limitation to note is that simply mapping frequencies of hands is not
 enough to produce complete results; additional consideration must be made
 to check for straights and flushes.
 However, this does not pose a significant challenge, as simple checks can
 be made if the highest frequency found is 1 to see whether all the suits
 are the same, or if the 5 cards are sequential.

These kind of approaches to hand evaluation have reasonable efficiency,
 with the potential to evaluate many hundreds of thousands of poker hands
 per second, and considering the relative ease of implementation are perfect
 for most purposes.
 However, more efficient algorithms require less processing power enabling
 higher throughput and faster execution times, and as such can be hugely
 beneficial for large scale applications.
 Other approaches to hand evaluators generally are not so simple, using
 shrewd techniques and taking full advantage of the efficiency of low level
 languages such as C.
 One such evaluator is Cactus Kev's

\end_inset

, the principle component of which is the realisation that while there are
 2,598,960 possible combinations of Poker Hands, these can be sorted into
 7462 distinct categories.
 Through the use of various methods including efficient card representations,
 bitwise operations, lookup tables and binary searches, an incredibly fast
 hand evaluator can be constructed.
 The main disadvantage of using such an approach is the complexity to implement,
 and the ease of deployment is entirely dependent on the specific environment
 due to the nature of compiled C code.
 In addition, the feasibility of using such an evaluator is dependent on
 the compatibility of any other technologies and languages used.

Use Case and Data Flow Diagrams
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the complexity of the Application will be hidden from the user,
 with heavy processing of data and algorithms handled behind the scenes.
 In terms of interaction with the application there will be a frontend interface
 which will allow the user to interact with and play against the Intelligent
 Agent.
 At its highest level of abstraction from the user's perspective, a use
 case can simply boil down to the diagram below.

 considers individual actions a user will need to be able to carry out,
 which is presented below.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace smallskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the Application to function there must be a sequential process of user
 inputs followed by Application outputs, demanding further inputs and so
 on.
 For example, after a user places their cards for one round, the Application
 must output a response with the Intelligent Agent's card placements as
 well as the next card for the player to place.
 In order for this to work there must be at least 2 tiers for the application:
 a frontend and a backend.
 The frontend will be responsible for displaying information to the user
 and handling the interface, while the backend will be responsible for the
 main processing tasks such as processing the game state, determining the
 Intelligent Agent's moves and handling the game logic.
 This will require a 2 way flow of information from the frontend of the
 Application to the backend, with the frontend sending data describing the
 user's inputs to the backend, which will process this and return a formatted
 response which the frontend can interpret and display to the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, the Application will make use of a standard three tier architecture
, with a frontend for client interacton; an Application layer for the processing
 tasks and communication between the higher and lower tiers; and a database
 for storage and management of game state information.
 A data flow diagram has been constructed to visualise this process.

Design Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most client requests will be handled by a Web Server serving static content
 such as images, CSS and JavaScript files.
 Dynamic requests, however, will be passed by the Web Server to an Application
 server, which will then process the request, undertaking any necessary
 interactions with other pieces of software before formatting and returning
 a response.
 This response will then be passed up from the Application Server to the
 Web Server and from there back to the client's browser.
 The diagram below illustrates this process.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lower level of abstraction from this System Architecture considers specific
 technologies which will enable the system to function as a whole.
 The Application will be hosted using a Virtual Private Server running Ubuntu
 14.04, aided by various technologies.
 Use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript will be largely responsible for the frontend
 of the application and will be served using an Nginx reverse proxy server.
 The Jinja2 template engine will be utilised in order to produce dynamic
 web pages, which will be served through Nginx by an Application Server
 implemented with CherryPy, a Pythonic Web Application Framework.
 User actions which require a response will be handled using JavaScript
 which will send HTTP POST requests containing the game state information
 to the CherryPy server.
 Here, the request will be parsed and sent on to the backend for processing,
 which will be handled with Python scripts.
 The backend will validate the sent game state and call helper functions
 and scripts to handle processes such as hand evaluation and scoring, handling
 the Intelligent Agent's turn and dealing cards.
 If everything is in order and once all necessary processes have been completed,
 the game state will be stored in a MongoDB document-oriented database,
 and an appropriate response containing information for the frontend will
 be produced in JSON format and sent back to the client.
 The JavaScript will parse and handle this response, reflecting the updates
 to the game state on the web page by dynamically creating and updating
 HTML DOM Element Objects.

Wireframe

\begin_layout Standard
The Application's frontend will consist of one dynamic webpage, using Jinja2
 templates to enable persistent information across multiple rounds and page
 refreshes, with content dynamically updated and created using JavaScript
 as required.
 Following Jakob Nielsen's general principles for interaction design (Nielsen,
 1994, p115), the interface for the site will be made as intuitive as possible
 with a clear, well-structured layout.
 The simpler the interface, the easier to understand and use, and following
 this concept the wireframe mockup presented below was produced.

\begin_layout Standard
The player and Intelligent Agent have distinct, separate play areas on either
 side of the screen where they will place their respective cards.
 Use of the interface is as simple as possible, with cards to be placed
 appearing at the bottom of the screen to be dragged and dropped into free
 positions on the board.
 The process of starting a game, finalising card placements and moving onto
 a new round will all be controlled through one dynamic button, making the
 game process as simple and intuitive as possible for the user; there are
 no surprises and behaviour remains consistent throughout the game.
 This is in strict adherence to Nielsen's aforementioned usability principles,
 specifically regarding consistency.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Design Principles 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The design principle to adhere to throughout the process of creating the
 application will be Rapid Application Development using Evolutionary Prototypin
g, creating a functional prototype at each stage which can be refined and
 updated to implement new features and meet changing requirements per user
 feedback.
 This approach is ideal for the needs of the project as it allows for a
 flexible approach and means that emphasis can be put on development, creating
 a functional or semi-functional application at each stage, implementing
 some of the planned features, meeting some of the requirements and being
 ready to build upon and develop further into a new version which improves
 upon itself.
 This flexible style is naturally advantageous over a more traditional approach
 such as the Waterfall model which involves rigorously defining specifications
 from the start, which means making changes down the line becomes increasingly
 difficult and costly; such a style of development was appropriated from
 other industries before more suitable methodologies of software development
 were formalised.
 Rapid Application Development allows for a versatile development-driven
 approach which naturally incorporates user feedback, design and testing
 as part of the cyclic process, which hopefully will result in a better,
 well-rounded final product.

 It was set up with a custom stack along the lines of a LEMP stack, although
 with some minor changes, using Ubuntu 14.04, Nginx, MongoDB and Python.
 This allowed for a powerful, customisable and robust architecture that
 met the needs of the project well.
 Originally a simple LAMP stack was used, but this was reconfigured and
 modified over time meeting changing requirements and implementing changes
 to increase performance; the lightweight nature of nginx is naturally advantage
ous over the bulkier Apache and better suited the needs of this project

Frontend (OFCP Game Webpage)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The page for the Web-Application was created with HTML, CSS and Javascript,
 with Jinja2 templates used to create persistent, consistent content across
 page refreshes and round changes.
 This was important so that the scores were retained across multiple rounds,
 and was useful for storing information pertaining to each specific page
 such as the game id and and a boolean used in ascertaining whether the
 player or Intelligent Agent acts first.
 This also allowed for dynamic creation of page elements, namely, the cards
 placed, which meant that these could be displayed across page refreshes
 without being lost.

Most of the aesthetics were controlled through external style sheets, allowing
 for easy customisation of layouts.
 That said, certain styling information was controlled inline or through
 modification with JavaScript.
 One example of this is the styling of the board positions for the player;
 when a user drags a card their board positions are highlighted in green
 for increased usability and visual appeal, which is controlled through
 JavaScript in the drag event handlers.

Middle Tier (Web Server and Application Server)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application makes use of pure python networking with CherryPy, which
 is an efficient and lightweight Web Framework.
 Using CherryPy for the application server worked well as it can handle
 up to 1000 concurrent requests, which is more than enough for the requirements
 of this project.
 This part of the application is responsible for handling requests for dynamic
 content, acting as a middle man between the frontend and the backend of
 the system.
 The CherryPy server handles parameters received and processes these, returning
 a dynamically created template as appropriate.
 It is also responsible for listening for HTTP POST requests from the frontend,
 which contain game state information that is decoded and sent to the backend
 for processing, before returning the formatted response to the client.

, reducing stress on the Application server as nginx was configured to handle
 client requests for static resources.
 CherryPy could have handled these requests as well but configuring the
 application in this manner means that scalability in the future is more
 feasible, and played to the strengths of nginx which can handle large amounts
 of concurrent users and excels at serving static content.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Backend (Processing and Database)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core functionality of the backend is handled entirely through Python
 scripts, handling the various necessary processes such as validation of
 game states, dealing of cards, handling the Intelligent Agent's card placements
, hand evaluation and scoring and communication with the database.
 These processes were subdivided into multiple scripts to form a more coherent
 structure, with independent scripts called as needed from a main game_logic
 handler.
 The diagram below shows a breakdown of the structure of the backend.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Game_logic.py processes the game state, working out what stage the game is
 in and handling the necessary logic and game flow.
 This main script is responsible for validating the game state passed from
 the frontend against the recorded game state in the MongoDB database.
 Cards are retrieved from a deck object (initialised at the start of a round)
 which are passed back to the player or through to the AI script as appropriate.
 In OFCP_AI.py the Agent's moves are decided through running Monte Carlo
 simulations of possible placements of the given card(s) in the current
 game state.
 Use of supplementary functions in helpers.py allows the AI to score simulated
 game boards in order to calculate and aggregate the expected value for
 various moves.
 Once the Agent has determined its move this is passed back to the main
 game_logic.py script, which formats this information in the game state to
 be returned to the frontend along with the player's next card, and updates
 the stored state in the database.
 At the end of a round game_logic.py calls a scoring function in helpers.py
 and then updates the database and returns this scoring information to the
 frontend for display.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MongoDB is a document-oriented database (as opposed to a traditional relational
 database e.g.
 using SQL), which decreased development time and reduced complexity as
 there was no need to constantly transform the data when reading from the
 database into the python backend.
 MongoDB offers a scalable and high performance solution to data storage,
 and allows for flexible data structures, for example with optional values
 being handled trivially.
 The database gets type information from the data itself meaning it can
 map easily into program objects, which is specifically advantageous in
 this application because of the use of dictionaries to store the game state.
 The flexibility and ease of deployment of such a style of database makes
 its use well suited for web-applications such as this one.
 For ease of deployability and redployability, MongoDB was set up to run
 in a virtual docker environment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Distributed Version Control System 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use of version control is paramount as it allows for undesirable changes
 to be rolled back easily, and if something goes wrong there are always
 working versions available to roll back to.
 In this project I opted for the use of GitHub due to its high usability
 and support.
 Using multiple branches (master and experimental) meant that a stable version
 could be maintained while new features were implemented safely on the experimen
tal branch without affecting or potentially breaking the master version.
 GitHub also allows for releases of different versions of the software,
 which was useful for maintaining historical releases of stable, working
 applications, for example a legacy client-side only prototype of the applicatio
n.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advantage of a Distributed Version Control System such as GitHub in
 comparison to Local or Centralised Version Control is that there is not
 one single point of failure; without proper alternative backups there is
 a credible risk of losing everything in the case of a failure.
 With a DVCS the entire repository is mirrored by clients meaning there
 are multiple backups, any of which can be used to restore the repository.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Intelligent Agent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
General Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general method used to implement the Intelligent Agent was a simple
 Monte Carlo approach.
 Although there are 13 separate positions to decide between for the placement
 of a card, because the order of cards in each row does not matter the effective
 choice is between either top, middle or bottom row.
 The Agent carries out Monte Carlo simulations of its given card in each
 of the rows many times, populating the rest of the board with random cards
 and scoring the game state, recording this result.
 After all simulations have been carried out, results are aggregated and
 the row which produced the best results is chosen for the card placement.
 The random nature of this methodology means initial results are naturally
 unreliable, but as the iterations increase the results produced become
 more and more reliable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
First 5 Card Placements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the Intelligent Agent to determine the optimal placements for the first
 5 cards, analysis is first performed to find all permutations of possible
 card placements.
 This results in an initial total of 
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{13}{5}=1287$
\end_inset

 states, but this can be pruned down further by removing duplicate states
 with the same cards in each row but ordered differently, reducing the maximum
 possible states to consider to around 240 which is a more manageable amount
 although still isn't ideal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, heuristics and domain specific knowledge are implemented to further
 prune the number of states considered.
 The hand is evaluated, mapping the frequencies of each occurring rank in
 a histogram.
 In the case that the hand contains a Pair, Three of a Kind, or Four of
 a Kind then any states which do not place these cards in the same row can
 be pruned as they would almost inevitably be sub-optimal.
 The better the initial starting hand, the fewer possible states the Agent
 must consider.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the worst case scenario with 5 unique ranks and no flush or straight
 potential, some last resort pruning is implemented, removing certain state
 combinations that can be considered unlikely to produce optimal results,
 such as placing all cards in middle, or having three cards dumped in the
 top row.
 This reduces the number of states to consider, although will still likely
 mean the Agent must consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim200$
\end_inset

 different states.
 Considering the requirement for the Agent to return its move in 5 seconds,
 this will likely result in suboptimal placements as there will only be
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim\frac{5}{200}$
\end_inset

 seconds worth of computation time spent simulating each state.
 Such a limitation is unfortunate, and is discussed later in this report
 in the Evaluation section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results of each game playout are stored and after all simulations have
 been completed the results are aggregated and the most promising scoring
 state's card placements are chosen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
1 Card Placements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subsequent card placements are a lot easier and do not require such bespoke
 analysis, simply carrying out simulations of the given card's placement
 in each row for as many seconds as possible.
 The allowed simulation time is hardcoded in the AI script, and was tweaked
 in response to user feedback and demands for the Agent's performance.
 A 5 second response meets the requirements specified, although users generally
 found that 5 seconds seemed too slow, and a sweet spot for trade-off between
 responsiveness and usable results was between 2 and 4 seconds.
 With 1 card placement and only 3 choices to make (place card in top, middle
 or bottom), thousands of simulations for each placement can be achieved
 even on low-spec hardware, which generally produced close to optimal results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Optimisations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Web-Application functions well, and the System Architecture is robust.
 Performance issues arise in the backend however due to heavy processing
 demands from the Intelligent Agent.
 As aforementioned, use of heuristics to prune the potential game states
 for the initial 5 placements were implemented in order to reduce the complexity
 of the search space, and this had a dramatic improvement on the Agent's
 performance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further optimisation could be had through implementation of a more sophisticated
 algorithm, as well as by using a more efficient language.
 The hand evaluator used produces complete results and has reasonable efficiency
, although again in this regard a more efficient evaluator would have increased
 overall performance.
 Time constraints on the project were the main reason why fundamental improvemen
ts to these areas of the system could not be made, although attempts were
 made to mitigate performance issues through further heuristics and techniques.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, using Cython
\begin_inset Foot

 noticeably increased the performance of the system, although involved compiling
 the modules after every change, which in many ways subverted the usefulness
 of developing in Python in the first place, and produced very bulky compiled
 scripts.
 Fortunately however, a more suitable solution was found through the use
 of PyPy

 compiler capable of converting Python to machine code at run time.
 The speed increase with PyPy was comparable to that of Cython and preferable
 in the sense that it simply worked - there was no need to compile modules
 every time a change was made - which allowed for faster deployment of updates
 and produced just as good results.

The tests ran are included in the Unittest subdirectory of the code submitted,
 along with evidence of output.
 All tests ran passed, or in the case of failure, appropriate fixes were
 implemented, and then the tests were run again to ensure these changes
 had the desired effect.
 This only occurred in a few cases where proper input validation was lacking,
 and in one case, a minor bug where the wrong variable was being returned
 by the OFCP_AI chooseMove function.

User and Usability Tests 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
User testing was an ongoing process throughout the development life cycle
 of the project, in line with the demands of a Rapid Application Development
 approach.
 User feedback was crucial at every stage impacting decisions regarding
 tweaking the Intelligent Agent's behaviour, making UI changes and updates
 and general feedback about potential improvements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to getting user feedback after major code changes, usability
 tests were conducted to make sure that users were able to use the application
 properly, asking users to play through several rounds in the application
 and seeing how well they were able to undertake this task.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results from this first usability test were very promising; it is clear
 that the design choices for a simple, clear layout paid off.
 The user did hesitate momentarily at times, but quickly managed to work
 out how to proceed without any prompting.
 When asked for feedback the user said they found the interface visually
 appealing, although did mention that it was initially distracting.
 The reason for this was because of the dragon background, which at the
 time stood out very vibrantly, as seen below.

\begin_layout Standard
In response to this feedback I made a subtle change to the interface in
 order to mitigate the potentially distracting nature of this background;
 the ease of use and intuitive nature of the interface is more important
 than simple visual appeal.
 The redesigned interface simply used a slightly transparent version of
 the same image, as shown below.

 who was not.

\begin_layout Standard
Overall I was pleased with the results garnered from these usability tests.
 I believe the steps I took to increase the usability of the interface such
 as highlighting where to place cards when dragging cards, as well as sticking
 to a simple layout paid off, as evidenced by the fact that the users quickly
 picked up on how to play the game and use the UI effectively.
 The change to the background image seemed well received when shown to User
 #1 from the first usability test, and based off of how quickly User #2
 and #3 picked up on the interface it would seem that the interface has
 good usability.

Critical Appraisal 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Frontend
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The frontend for the application is functional and aesthetically pleasing,
 but would have benefited from being designed better from the start.
 For example, originally hard-coding player's card image objects rather
 than dynamically creating them with JavaScript lead to problems down the
 line which required hack-like workarounds until later refactoring improved
 the design.
 One important issue to note with the frontend is cross-platform compatibility.
 Browsers such as older versions of Internet Explorer are not supported,
 and the application does not display well on smaller screens.
 Some basic efforts were made to support as many platforms as possible,
 with measures taken to ensure that the board's structure would not break
 when viewed on a low resolution device or when zoomed in at the browser
 level.
 In addition to this, basic support for mobile devices was implemented with
 an iOS HTML5 drag and drop shim, necessitated because of my choice to implement
 the application with pure JavaScript.
 In hindsight, use of JQuery may have been more appropriate as drag and
 drop event handlers would automatically have cross-platform support, but
 development in this manner required me to really get to grips with understandin
g and becoming competent with JavaScript and so in my mind was a fundamentally
 important and useful process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Backend
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The backend works well overall and I am very pleased with the system structure
 and design.
 Performance wise if different technologies and languages were used there
 is a huge potential for increased efficiency.
 For example writing the heavy-lifting backend scripts in C would have been
 hugely beneficial, and using a more efficient hand evaluator algorithm
 that could evaluate millions of hands per second rather than hundreds of
 thousands could shave off seconds of processing time.
 This hypothetical performance increase could either lead to increased responsiv
eness or allow for more games to be simulated by the Intelligent Agent making
 it more likely to find optimal solutions for hand placements.
 In addition the overall footprint of the application would be reduced,
 allowing for increased scalability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout the course of the development of the application, many games
 were played versus the various iterations of the Intelligent Agent, from
 its origins with entirely naïve placements through to its current iteration,
 using a Monte Carlo approach aided by domain specific knowledge.
 The improvements over time were therefore incredibly noticeable, with early
 prototypes struggling to even produce a legitimate, non-fouling board,
 and later iterations able to make optimal plays which implicitly took into
 account the opposing player's moves.
 Despite the increasing ability of the Agent over time, however, the simple
 approach limited its potential and it is unfortunate that time constraints
 prevented me from producing a more sophisticated implementation, and it
 is something I intend to work on improving in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Software Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The choice of a flexible software methodology worked well overall because
 of the evolving requirements and design choices, as well as the individual
 nature of the project.
 In comparison, in a large team of developers issues with this approach
 could arise from lacking a clear design focus and having limited control
 - a necessary trade-off that is an inevitable consequence of the increased
 flexibility this methodology enables.
 One important pitfall to avoid with Rapid Application Development is focusing
 too much on individual components without getting a clear view of the system's
 design, making minor changes without considering possibilities for an improved
 design structure.
 While there is generally a clear design phase before entering the initial
 implementation stage, there can be a tendency to omit a renewed design
 phase in subsequent implementation cycles leading to a lack of documentation
 which can have large consequences down the line; as Gerber et al.
 (2007) state in the analysis of one case study 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

...
 due to the fact that the design was not formally documented and reviewed,
 the discrepancy was only discovered after the implementation phase.
 This situation caused conflict between developers and analysts and in the
 end necessitated a redesign effort which put unnecessary pressure due to
 time constraints and limited resources on the whole development team
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Design choices in early prototypes had a carry-on effect which meant that
 later down the line code refactoring was necessary in order to create a
 more coherent system structure, which potentially could have been avoided
 or reduced with a stricter design philosophy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An apt example of this is seen in legacy prototypes of the application,
 which were client-side only.
 This was a choice that was made in order to quickly create a functional
 prototype, using JavaScript to simulate processes that would be handled
 elsewhere in the final application's architecture (such as dealing cards).
 This was useful because it resulted in a functional application which implement
ed some of the planned features, leading to a clearer understanding of the
 needs of the project, but had to be adapted later in order to create a
 more logical system structure which could meet the requirements, such as
 backend processing to handle the game states and calculate the Intelligent
 Agent's moves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Improvements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In line with user feedback, there is a demand for multiplayer support for
 players vs players as well as players vs AI(s).
 Implementing this would allow for a more well-rounded, feature-full application
 and is certainly a consideration for the future.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other feedback from users indicated a desire for support of other variants
 such as Pineapple OFC.
 This is indeed something I am interested in doing, as Pineapple includes
 elements of hidden information due to players placing 2 of 3 cards at once
 and choosing 1 to discard, the identity of which is known only to them.
 This adds another layer of depth to the game, and increases the complexity
 of game which would require further modifications and improvements to the
 Intelligent Agent.
 Performance issues faced in the Agent for standard OFC would become even
 more of an obstacle which would almost certainly mean that use of more
 sophisticated algorithms would be necessary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most important area of improvement in my mind is the performance of
 the Intelligent Agent.
 While the general ability of the Intelligent Agent is adequate, it is clear
 that there is room for improvement.
 Despite generally choosing optimal placements it is important that the
 limitations of the method used are acknowledged, as Whitehouse et al assert
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

with any method based on random simulation, it is inevitable that poor quality
 moves will be chosen with nonzero probability, due to a particularly lucky
 run of simulations making the move appear better than it is
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Whitehouse et al, 2013, p104).
 Due to the need for a compromise between finding the optimal solution and
 finishing the request in a reasonable amount of time the number of simulated
 games is limited and therefore it is possible that sub-optimal plays will
 be over-valued due to the element of randomness.
 This potential for inaccurate evaluation of a move's strength has an inverse
 relationship with the number of iterations of simulated games - as the
 number of iterations increase the result diverges to the optimal solution,
 meaning that with an infinite amount of simulations the probability of
 finding the best move is 1.
 The performance of the Intelligent Agent therefore could be improved with
 more processing power and/or a longer allocated time to simulate games,
 although it is important to note that there are diminishing returns with
 this strategy; doubling the iterations does not mean that the results will
 be twice as good.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This ties in with the choices made for the implementation and configuration
 of the Agent, specifically in regards to compromises between responsiveness
 and finding the best move - in the specified requirements the Agent was
 intended to take no more than 5 seconds to calculate its turn, and the
 application satisfies this requirement.
 However, increasing the iterations would make satisfying this criteria
 infeasible without increased processing power or through further optimisation.
 This could be achieved in various ways, for example by rewriting the applicatio
n in a more efficient language such as C, or by implementing more advanced
 heuristics to reduce the complexity of the calculations, or using a different
 algorithm such as a more advanced implementation of the Monte Carlo method
 like Monte Carlo Tree Search with UCT, as discussed in Section 2 of this
 dissertation.
 Overall the implementation of the Intelligent Agent satisfies the specified
 requirements and performs adequately for its intended purpose in the scope
 of this application, but for larger scale implementations would likely
 need to make use of one or more of these changes in order to achieve increased
 scalability, for example for use in a commercial application with thousands
 of concurrent users.

Reflection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This project was a daunting task, but the experience was in all a thoroughly
 enjoyable one.
 It enabled me to build on a wider skill-set, and required me to immerse
 myself in several different aspects of Computer Science and Software Engineerin
g.
 Artificial Intelligence was an area I had only very little prior experience
 with, and while conceptually at times difficult to follow, I feel that
 I have learnt a lot and it is has definitely sparked an interest in this
 field of study.
 Creation of the final product required a culmination of various technologies
 and disciplines, giving me broad exposure to many new concepts along the
 way.
 Sharpening up my programming abilities in Python and JavaScript was certainly
 a beneficial process, and I also learned a lot about web design and web
 technologies in the process.
 Furthermore, hosting the application on a dedicated website using a Virtual
 Private Server required me to take on a role of System Administration,
 brushing up on UNIX commands, learning more about security measures and
 gaining a wider understanding of networking and system architecture.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion the Intelligent Agent produced performed adequately well and
 largely ticked the boxes in terms of requirements specified, demonstrating
 the versatility of Monte Carlo methods; with little domain specific knowledge,
 usable results were obtainable.
 The Web-Application itself worked well for its intended purpose and shows
 promising scalability, with a robust and sensible system architecture,
 and the final interface produced was user-friendly and visually appealing.
 The technologies and methodologies employed enabled very fast turnover
 of prototypes and new software iterations, which turned out to be critically
 useful in making improvements to the system in response to user feedback.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Room for improvement can be had in many aspects however.
 Using Python allowed for quick development but the application could have
 benefited from the use of a more efficient language such as C, although
 these performance concerns were partially mitigated through the use of
 PyPy.
 The Intelligent Agent's simplistic approach could be expanded upon and
 improved, and fundamentally there are limitations with the approach used.
 The simple Monte Carlo methods used produce good results but are CPU intensive
 and necessarily require a tradeoff at some level between finding an optimal
 solution and getting fast results.
 It would be interesting to note the effect and improvements that implementation
 of more sophisticated Monte Carlo methods such as MCTS with UCT could achieve,
 and I look forward to further development of the Intelligent Agent in this
 respect.

\begin_layout Subsection
Poker Variants
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Texas Hold'Em
\series default
 is a popular variant of Poker where each player receives 2 cards for use
 individually in combination with 5 community cards shared between all players,
 with players combining any of their available cards in order to create
 the strongest standard poker hand possible
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Chinese Poker
\series default
 is a variant of poker where players are dealt 13 cards which they must
 arrange into three rows, placed face down.
 Players announce in clockwise order whether or not they wish to play their
 hand, and then all players announce their royalties and show their cards
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Open Face Chinese Poker
\series default
 is a variant of Chinese Poker where players act in clockwise order, receiving
 first 5 cards which are placed face up and then one card at a time until
 all players have placed 13 cards.
 Players must create valid hands consisting of stronger poker hands in lower
 rows, and score points from their opponents for winning corresponding rows.
 Additional points known as royalties can be won for particularly strong
 hands
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Pineapple OFC 
\series default
is a sub-variant of Open Face Chinese Poker, following the same basic rules
 as the standard variant with the distinction that in subsequent rounds
 after the initial 5 card placements, players receive 3 cards and choose
 to place 2 and discard 1.
 This introduces higher action play as well as elements of hidden information
 as other players are unaware of which cards their opponents have discarded,
 although there is potential to infer this information based off of how
 the player acts 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Poker Hands Guide (Weakest to Strongest)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
High Card
\series default
 is the lowest ranking poker hand and is the default when no other hands
 have been made.
 An example High Card is the Jack of Spades, which would beat any hand comprised
 of a High Card ranked 10 or less, but would lose to a High Card Queen,
 King, Ace, or any stronger poker hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Pair
\series default
 is the second weakest poker hand.
 A player has a pair when they have two cards of the same rank, for example
 the 7 of Hearts and 7 and Clubs would form a Pair of 7s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Two Pair
\series default
 is the next strongest hand rank, consisting of two different pairs.
 For example having the 5 of Spades, 5 of Diamonds, 9 of Hearts and 9 of
 Clubs would form Two Pair 9s and 5s.
 When comparing a Two Pair to another Two Pair the highest ranked pair takes
 precedence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Three of a Kind
\series default
 or a 
\series bold
Set
\series default
 beats Two Pairs, Pairs and High Cards and consists of three same-ranked
 cards, such as the Ace of Spades, Ace of Diamonds and Ace of Hearts, which
 would form Three of a Kind Aces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Straight
\series default
 is a hand where a player has 5 sequential cards, such as 4 of Diamonds,
 5 of Hearts, 6 of Hearts, 7 of Clubs, 8 of Spades, which would form a Straight
 8 High.
 The lowest ranked straight spans Ace to 5 and the highest ranked straight
 spans 10 to Ace.
 It is important to note that straights do not wrap around; you cannot form
 a straight such as Queen, King, Ace, Deuce, 3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Flush
\series default
 is one of the stronger poker hands, consisting of cards which are all the
 same suit.
 For example the 6 of Hearts, 9 of Hearts, Jack of Hearts, Queen of Hearts
 and King of Hearts would form a King High Flush.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Full House
\series default
, sometimes known as a 
\series bold
Boat
\series default
, is one of the strongest poker hands available, and comprises both a Three
 of a Kind and an additional Pair.
 For example Three of a Kind Tens with Pair of Jacks would combine to form
 a Full House, Tens full of Jacks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Four of a Kind
\series default
 is a hand obtained when a player has every instance of a particular card
 rank, such as King of Hearts, King of Diamonds, King of Clubs and King
 of Spades which would form Four of a Kind Kings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Straight Flush
\series default
 is effectively the strongest poker hand possible, consisting of 5 sequential
 same suited cards.
 For example the 4 of Spades, 5 of Spades, 6 of Spades, 7 of Spades and
 8 of Spades would form a Straight Flush 8 High.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Royal Flush
\series default
 is a special instance of a Straight Flush where a player has the 10, Jack,
 Queen, King and Ace of a particular suit.
 Royal Flushes are particularly rare; in Texas Hold'Em for example the probabili
ty of getting a Royal Flush is approximately 0.000154%.

\begin_layout Itemize
A 
\series bold
row
\series default
 is a set structure for placing cards.
 At the end of a game when scoring occurs poker hands in each player's rows
 are compared to the opposing player's hand in their corresponding row.
 There are three different rows as described below
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Bottom Row
\series default
 or 
\series bold
Back Hand
\series default
 is the foundation row, and consists of 5 cards.
 Out of all three rows this must have the strongest poker hand or the player
 fouls.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Middle Row 
\series default
or 
\series bold
Middle Hand 
\series default
also consists of 5 cards.
 It must have a weaker hand than Bottom Row in order for the player's hand
 to be valid.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Top Row
\series default
 or 
\series bold
Front Hand
\series default
 consists of 3 cards, meaning the best possible hand here is a Three of
 a Kind (in most variants 3 card straights and flushes do not count).
 Top Row must have a weaker hand than both middle and bottom row.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Scoop
\series default
 is a bonus awarded to a player when they win all 3 rows against an opponent.
 On top of the standard +1 point per row won, the player is granted an additiona
l bonus of +3 points which is also taken from their opponent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Fouling
\series default
 occurs when a player plays an invalid hand, for example by putting a stronger
 hand in their middle row than their bottom row.
 When a player fouls any of their royalties are null, and their opponent
 is automatically awarded a scoop bonus so long as their hand is valid.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Kicker
\series default
 is the term used to describe the next card taken into account when comparing
 two otherwise equal hands.
 For example, if both Player 1 and Player 2 have a Pair of 8s then the rest
 of their cards would be considered, and whichever player has the highest
 rank wins.
 If both players kicker is equivalent then the next highest kicker will
 come into play and so on.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Royalties
\series default
 are bonus points awarded to player's for particularly strong hands.
 Just like any other points a player wins, they are taken directly from
 opposing players.
 Hands in higher rows score higher royalties than equivalent hands in lower
 rows.
 For example, a Full House in bottom row is worth 6 points in bottom or
 12 points in middle.
 Another example is that a Three of a Kind in bottom row scores no royalty,
 but gets 2 bonus points in middle and between 10 and 22 points in top depending
 on the rank (Three of a Kind Deuces scores 10 points up to Three of a Kind
 Aces with 22 points).
